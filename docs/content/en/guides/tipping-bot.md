# Lotus? What is this?

Lotus is a digital token used to show appreciation for people who are doing and saying things which you appreciate. A "token of appreciation," it aims to foster positive interactions on the internet by rewarding people who are contributing positively. Additionally, a Lotus is a currency for use within a number of social apps built on Lotus such as the tipping bot itself.
